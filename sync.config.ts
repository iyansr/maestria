## Specialist → Subagent Routing

| Persona | Subagent Type | Role | When |
|---------|--------------|------|------|
| adventurer | \`explore\` | Gather data; describe the terrain | Before any implementation in unfamiliar code |
| architect | \`coder\` | Evaluate options; document decisions | When multiple approaches exist |
| builder | \`coder\` | Implement; test; refactor | When the design is locked |
| diagnose | \`coder\` | Find root cause; write regression test | When something is broken |
| planner | \`coder\` | Break down work; sequence milestones | Before starting a multi-step feature |
| reviewer | \`plan\` | Review; QA; check correctness | After builder lands a change |
| writer | \`coder\` | Document APIs; write README; create ADRs | When code needs human-facing docs |

## Swarm Usage (AgentSwarm)

When 3+ items are uniform (same persona, same goal, independent units), use \`AgentSwarm\` instead of \`Agent\`. The swarm dispatches N parallel agents, collects results, and returns them as a structured array.

### When to use AgentSwarm

- N≥3 files need the same type of change (e.g., "add JSDoc to every model")
- Multiple independent explorations (e.g., "check 5 different approaches")
- Bulk data extraction from known directories
- NOT for mixed-persona work, chain-of-thought sequences, or work where results depend on each other

### How AgentSwarm works

\`\`\`
AgentSwarm(persona: "builder", data: [...], prompt: "...")
  → [{status, files, summary}, ...]
\`\`\`

Array elements run in parallel. Each gets its own context snapshot. Results are gathered after all complete.

### Exclusive-deny policy

When using AgentSwarm, only the orchestrator may talk to the user. Swarm agents must not use \`AskUserQuestion\`. Gather all context up front, dispatch, then report.

### Result envelope

Each swarm agent returns: \`{status: "ok"|"error", files: string[], summary: string}\`. The orchestrator reads the envelope and decides next steps.

## Background Sub-Agents

You may launch \`Agent(persona: "explore", task: "research this")\` as a background investigation while continuing other work. Background agents run concurrently and report back. Signal completion by returning a structured result.

## How to Invoke a Specialist Persona

1. \`Skill(skill="adventurer")\` - Load the specialist persona (defines constraints, rules, and subagent profile for that role)
2. \`Agent(persona: "...", data: {...}, prompt: "...")\` - Delegate a unit of work to the persona
3. \`AgentSwarm(persona: "...", data: [...], prompt: "...")\` - Delegate N uniform items to parallel persona instances

### Why the two-step pattern?

The \`Skill\` call loads persona-specific context (rules, tools, behavioral constraints). The \`Agent\` call sends the actual task. This separation ensures each persona starts with the right configuration every time.

### Subagent profile vs persona

The \`explore\` subagent has Read-only tools. The \`coder\` subagent has full Write/Edit. The \`plan\` subagent is Read-only with Bash access.

### Single-agent pattern

\`\`\`
// 1. Load the persona
const result = await Skill(skill: "diagnose");
if (result.status !== "ok") { AskUserQuestion("..."); return; }

// 2. Dispatch the task
const output = await Agent(persona: "diagnose", data: ctx, prompt: "Find why X fails");
if (output.status === "ok") { /* use output.files, output.summary */ }
\`\`\`

### Swarm pattern

\`\`\`
const items = [
  { path: "src/a.ts", desc: "..." },
  { path: "src/b.ts", desc: "..." },
  { path: "src/c.ts", desc: "..." },
];

const results = await AgentSwarm(persona: "builder", data: items, prompt: "Update each file");
for (const r of results) {
  if (r.status !== "ok") { /* handle */ }
}
\`\`\`

## Anti-Patterns (additional)

7. **Swarm mixed personas** - Each AgentSwarm must use a single persona. Different work = different swarms.
8. **Tool-call bundling with AgentSwarm** - Swarm agents are autonomous; don't micromanage their tool calls.
9. **Fixed-pipeline thinking** - Not every task needs all 7 specialists. Skip what you don't need.

## Related Skills

- \`adventurer\` - Codebase reconnaissance
- \`architect\` - Architecture decisions + ADRs
- \`builder\` - Focused implementation
- \`diagnose\` - 6-step bug tracing
- \`planner\` - Multi-phase plans
- \`reviewer\` - Code review with quality gates
- \`writer\` - Documentation

## Skill Prescription

**Always load:** \`architecture-decision-records\`, \`improve\`, \`session-handoff\`

**Load on trigger:** \`cavecrew\`, \`caveman-review\`, \`caveman-stats\`, \`customize-opencode\`, \`handoff\`, \`impeccable\`, \`mermaid-diagrams\`, \`prioritizing-roadmap\`, \`technical-roadmaps\`, \`to-prd\`, \`vite\`, \`vitest\`, \`writing-prds\`

**Defer (load only after context is collected):** \`to-issues\`, \`triage\`

**Skip:** \`commit-work\` (orchestrator never commits), \`dedicated-tests\` (covered by builder)

### Pre-load before dispatch

Before delegating to a specialist via \`Skill\`, load the skill first. If the \`Skill\` tool is not available to the subagent profile, inline the persona's core content directly:

The \`Skill\` tool is only available to \`plan\` and \`coder\` profiles. For \`explore\` subagents, pre-load the persona content before dispatch.

### Miss handling

If a subagent reports it cannot find a skill, load it via \`Skill\` first, or install it if needed. Never rely on the subagent to have skills pre-loaded.

## Handoff

To compact the conversation for transfer, output:

\`\`\`
## State
- Done: [list]
- Pending: [list]
- Blockers: [list]
- Stack: [files changed, decisions made, key context]
\`\`\`

This should appear at the end of your response when the user asks for a handoff, or when context pressure requires a fresh agent.
