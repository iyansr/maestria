# @maestria/kimi-code

A declarative, manifest-based Kimi Code plugin that ships 8 specialized skills (orchestrator + 7 specialists) for engineering workflows with swarm-aware orchestration.

## Install

See [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) for the full checklist. Quick start:

```
/plugins install https://github.com/agustinusnathaniel/maestria/tree/release/kimi-code
mkdir -p ~/.kimi-code && cp rules/AGENTS.md ~/.kimi-code/AGENTS.md
```

Alternatively, use the [maestria CLI](https://maestria.sznm.dev/cli/) to manage installation across all platforms from a single command.

## The 8 Skills at a Glance

| Skill | Subagent | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `orchestrator` | main | Auto-loaded at session start. Methodology, delegation, swarm. |
| `builder` | `coder` | Focused implementation - atomic tasks, write code, run tests. |
| `adventurer` | `explore` | Codebase reconnaissance - read-only exploration, structured reports. |
| `architect` | `coder` | Architecture decisions, trade-offs, ADRs. |
| `planner` | `plan` | Multi-phase implementation plans, success criteria, rollback. |
| `reviewer` | `coder` | Code review with quality gates - no editing, structured feedback. |
| `writer` | `coder` | Documentation - READMEs, API docs, changelogs, ADR transcription. |
| `diagnose` | `coder` | Root cause analysis - 6-step methodology, blast-radius audit. |

The orchestrator's `whenToUse` field teaches the model when to dispatch each persona. The 7 specialists are loaded on demand via the `Skill` tool.

## Design Philosophy

This plugin is built on the **Harness Engineering** principle: `Agent = Model + Harness`. The harness is what turns a raw LLM into a reliable coding agent - the model is just one component.

The 6 harness components map directly to plugin features:

| Component         | Plugin Mapping                                                               |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Instructions**  | `rules/AGENTS.md` placed at `~/.kimi-code/AGENTS.md` (auto-loaded)           |
| **Tools**         | Skill prescription per specialist; `AgentSwarm` for parallel fan-out         |
| **Sandboxes**     | Subagent profile tool lists (`coder`/`explore`/`plan`); `permission.rules`   |
| **Orchestration** | `sessionStart.skill` (orchestrator auto-loads); `Agent` / `AgentSwarm` tools |
| **Guardrails**    | `!!!` rule markers in every SKILL.md; iteration limits; persona constraints  |
| **Observability** | `PreCompact` / `PostCompact` hooks (observation-only); structured handoffs   |

Most agent failures are configuration failures, not model failures. The plugin's skills are designed with this principle - precise rules, explicit boundaries, and clear delegation chains over raw capability.

### How It Works

1. **Plugin loads** - Kimi Code parses `kimi.plugin.json` from the installed location.
2. **Skills discovered** - `skills/` is walked; each `SKILL.md` is parsed and registered.
3. **Session start** - `sessionStart.skill: "orchestrator"` injects the orchestrator's full body into the system prompt at session start.
4. **Rules loaded** - `~/.kimi-code/AGENTS.md` (which the user copies from `rules/AGENTS.md`) is auto-loaded by Kimi Code's session-start context preparer.
5. **Specialists dispatched** - the orchestrator loads specialist skills via the `Skill` tool and inlines them into `Agent` / `AgentSwarm` prompts.
6. **Swarm fan-out** - for ≥3 uniform items, `AgentSwarm` runs the same persona against a list of items, returning a single `<agent_swarm_result>` envelope.

### Declarative-Only

Unlike OpenCode's plugin SDK, Kimi Code's plugin system is **declarative** - no TypeScript, no SDK hooks, no build step. The plugin is just `kimi.plugin.json` + `skills/` + `rules/`. This means:

- **No build step** - edit, commit, install.
- **No programmatic hooks** - the orchestrator skill carries the methodology, and Kimi Code's `[[hooks]]` blocks (user-managed) cover the rest.
- **No custom subagent identity** - Kimi Code hardcodes `coder`/`explore`/`plan`. The 7 specialist identities are encoded as persona content in prompt templates.
